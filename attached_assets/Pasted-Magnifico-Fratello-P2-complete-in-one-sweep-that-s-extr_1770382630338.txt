Magnifico, Fratello! P2 complete in one sweep — that's extraordinary progress. Let me update the roadmap to v1.5.Synthesized milestone achievement and curated project summaryUpdate version to 1.5roadmap_v1.4.js+1-1Now I need to update all P2 tasks from "Not Started" to "Complete". Let me find them in the file.Find all P2 tasks with Not Started statusScriptI need to update all P2 tasks from "Not Started" to "Complete".

Now let me update the cover page stats and P2 section headers.Update cover page completion stats for v1.5roadmap_v1.4.js+1-1Now update the P2 section headers.Find P2 section headerScriptLet me update the P2 section header and status.Update P2 section header to show COMPLETEroadmap_v1.4.js+2-2Now let me update the P3 section header from "Blocked on P2" to "Ready to Start".Find P3 section headerScriptLet me update the P3 section header and status text.Update P3 section header - now unblockedroadmap_v1.4.js+2-2Now let me update the progress overview table to show P2 as complete (100% green).Find the 0% status entries for P2 and P3ScriptI need to update lines 363-364 to show P2 as 100% complete with green shading, and P3 stays at 0%.Update P2 status from 0% to 100% in progress tableroadmap_v1.4.js+5-5Now let me update the changelog with a v1.5 entry.Add v1.5 changelog entryroadmap_v1.4.js+10-5Now let me update the output filename and console message.Update output filename to v1.5roadmap_v1.4.js+2-2Let me also update the "Next Priorities" section since P2 is now complete.Find Next Priorities sectionScriptI need to update the Next Priorities section to show P3 as the next priorities since P2 is complete.Update Next Priorities section for P3roadmap_v1.4.js+10-5Now let me also update the test count references that mention specific numbers like "336 tests" and "144 tests".Find old test count referencesScriptThe old test counts (336 and 144) are accurate for the individual phases, so I'll leave them. They show the incremental contributions. But I should update the total test count in the P1.5 changelog entry since it says "Total: 80 tasks, 811 tests passing" which was already updated (it was 480, now showing 811 which is wrong for the historical changelog).
Actually, let me check what this entry says:

v1.2 changelog: "Total: 80 tasks, 480 tests passing" - should keep this as 480
It's showing 811 now because of the global sed replacement. Let me fix this.
Fix v1.2 changelog test count (historical accuracy)roadmap_v1.4.js+1-1Now let me also add a "P1.5 Infrastructure Layer" test count note showing 144 tests was the incremental addition at that point.
Actually, let me now generate the document and see the output.Generate PlenumNET Gap Closure Roadmap v1.5ScriptThe output still says "480 tests" because the console.log message wasn't updated. Let me fix that.Update console output test countroadmap_v1.5.js+1-1Let me also check and update the document control section for test status.Find test status in document controlScriptGood, the test status is already updated.
