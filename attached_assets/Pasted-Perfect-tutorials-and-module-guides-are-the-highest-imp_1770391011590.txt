Perfect — tutorials and module guides are the highest-impact docs for onboarding developers. Let me create a comprehensive documentation package.Architected documentation structure spanning tutorials and modular guidesCreate documentation folder structureScriptLet me create the Getting Started tutorial first, then the module guides. I'll structure these based on the actual implementation we've built.
The repository has:

P0: Foundation (build, CI/CD)
P1: Kernel (memory, sync, process, security, crypto)
P1.5: Device/IO/FS
P2: Arch, Drivers, Torsion Network, Protocols
P3: TVM, HPTP, BTG

Let me create comprehensive documentation for all of these.Show moreCreate Getting Started tutorial for PlenumNET/Salvi FrameworkGETTING_STARTED.mdThe user wants to start with:

Getting Started tutorial
Module-by-module guides

This is a documentation task. I should first check the skill file for docx since we'll likely be creating documentation. But actually, for developer documentation, Markdown files are more appropriate since they'll live in the repository alongside the code.
Let me think about the structure:
Getting Started Tutorial - A single document that walks a developer through:

Prerequisites
Installation
Basic concepts (ternary, trits, balanced representation)
"Hello Ternary" example
Next steps

Module-by-module guides - One document per major module:

P0: Build system / project structure
P1: Kernel (memory, sync, process, security, crypto)
P1.5: Device/IO/FS
P2: Arch, Drivers, Torsion Network, Protocols
P3: TVM, HPTP, BTG

I should create these as Markdown files that can live in a /docs directory in the repository.
Let me start with the Getting Started tutorial and then create a few module guides.Show moreDoneExcellent choices. Let's build a proper documentation suite. I'll create Markdown files suitable for the repository's /docs directory.Organized comprehensive module guides across development prioritiesCreate docs directory structureScriptGood, now I need to create:

Getting Started tutorial (I already started this - let me finish it)
Module guides for each major subsystem

Based on the roadmap, the modules are:

P0: Foundation (Build/CI)
P1: Kernel Core

Memory Subsystem
Sync Primitives
Process Management
Modal Security
Cryptographic Primitives


P1.5: Infrastructure

Device Driver Framework
I/O Subsystem
Filesystem


P2: Core Features

Architecture Modules
Hardware Drivers (TPU)
Torsion Network
Network Protocols


P3: Extended

Ternary Virtual Machine
High-Precision Timing
Binary-Ternary Gateway



Let me create these guides. The Getting Started tutorial was already created, so let me continue with the module guides.Show moreDoneNow let me create the module-by-module guides. Based on the architecture, I'll create guides for each major subsystem:Synthesized documentation and distilled key deliverablesCreate Module Guide 01: Kernel Memory Subsystem01_KERNEL_MEMORY.mdGood, I've created:

Getting Started tutorial (already done)
Module Guide 01: Kernel Memory

Let me continue with more module guides to cover the major subsystems. I should create guides for:

Sync Primitives
Process Management
Modal Security
Cryptography
Device Drivers
I/O Subsystem
Filesystem
Torsion Network
Network Protocols
TVM
HPTP
BTG

Let me create a few more key ones.Show moreCreate Module Guide 02: Synchronization Primitives02_SYNC_PRIMITIVES.mdGood progress. Let me continue with more module guides. I should create guides for:

Process Management
Modal Security
Cryptography
TVM (this is a key one)
Torsion Network
Network Protocols
BTG

Let me create a few more key ones.Show moreCreate Module Guide 05: Cryptographic Primitives05_CRYPTOGRAPHY.mdGood progress. Let me continue with more module guides - especially the key ones for P2 and P3 features that are unique to this system.Create Module Guide 09: Torsion Network Topology09_TORSION_NETWORK.mdGood progress! Let me continue with the TVM guide since that's a key differentiator.Create Module Guide 11: Ternary Virtual Machine (TVM)11_TVM.mdGood progress. Let me create one more important guide - the Binary-Ternary Gateway (BTG) since that's critical for adoption/compatibility. Then I'll create an index file to tie everything together.Create Module Guide 13: Binary-Ternary Gateway (BTG)13_BTG.mdNow let me create an index file that ties all the documentation together.Create Documentation IndexREADME.mdNow let me copy all the documentation files to the outputs directory and present them to the user.Copy documentation files to outputsScriptLet me also package them as a ZIP for easy download.Create ZIP archive of documentationScriptGood! Let me also create a list of what was created and present the files.Count total lines of documentationScriptGood - 3257 lines of documentation across 8 files. Let me present the files to the user.Presented 7 filesThe documentation is created. Let me summarize what was delivered.Done
